Sample code for various Java features.

Under src/com/samples/ there are the following programs
	enums- an interesting enum example which includes EnumMap, allowing the values of one enum to be mapped to the values of another enum.
	io - example of Java 6 and Java 7 style file IO, including character, byte and buffered examples. Of interest are the try-with-resources syntax while automatically closes resources, no longer requiring the boilerplate finally clause to close resources.
	reflection- how to call a method on an existing object using refelction.
	serialization- a standard deserialize/ serialize example.
        inner_classes/singleton- an example of the static holder singleton using an inner class.
